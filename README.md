# jplus
Jplus is a javascript utility framework. And it makes writing the javascript easier.  it's open source, so do whatever you want with this code.

It's an alternative to jquery for those who wants a easier, simple and faster framework. it's faster than jquery. it's optimized for performance in mind. 

please feel free to jsfiddle with it here: https://jsfiddle.net/tc2praLd/


I'm too busy to write the documentaton of this framework, i think if you look at the code closely you can clearly understand what this code does.
